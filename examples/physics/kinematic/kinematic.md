title: Kinematic physics
brief: This example shows a simple setup with a kinematic physics objects. The difference between dynamic objects, simulated by the physics engine, and kinematic objects, that are user controlled, is clearly seen here.

The setup consists of three game objects. The *game.project* physics *GravityY* property is set to -500 to match the scale of the setup.

block
: The square stone block. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with the stone block image.
  - A *Collision object* component. The *Type* is set to `KINEMATIC`. A box *Shape* matching the sprite image is added to the components.
  - A script that moves the game object to where the user clicks.

block2
: The rectangular stone block. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with the stone block image.
  - A *Collision object* component. Also has *Type* set to `DYNAMIC`, *Friction* set to 0 and *Restitution* to 1.0. A box *Shape* matching the sprite image is added to the components.

walls
: The outer walls. Contains:
  - A *Collision object* component. The *Type* is set to `STATIC`. 4 box *Shapes* are added to the component. These are placed just outside of the game view.
