This example shows how to dynamically spawn bullet game objects using a factory component and how to also move and delete the bullets. The setup consists of two game objects; one for the player and one for the bullet that is spawned using a factory component.

Combine this example with some of the examples from the movement and physics categories to create a shoot 'em up game!

player
: The red ship at the bottom. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with the spaceship image.
  - A *Factory* component to spawn bullet game objects
  - A script to handle spawning of bullets.

bullet
: The bullet fired by the player. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with a bullet image.
