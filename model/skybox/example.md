This example shows how to create a skybox. A skybox is a technique that makes the scene look bigger and more impressive by wrapping the viewer with a texture that goes around the camera 360 degrees.

An in-depth explanation of skybox rendering can be found in [Tutorial 25 of OGL Dev](https://www.ogldev.org/www/tutorial25/tutorial25.html).
