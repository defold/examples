The example shows how to use Defold built-in timer and trigger it asynchronously and uses two indicators:

1. A counter text increased every 1s created using a text node.
2. A text node with information displayed.

The timer triggers update of the counter every 1s.
Click anywhere to trigger the callback of the timer asynchronously.
