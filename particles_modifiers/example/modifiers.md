Here two modifiers are added to the effect in addition to the emitter. It works as follows:

* The wide box emitter emits particles with a low speed.
* The *Acceleration* modifier pushes the particles causing them to continuously speed up.
* The *Vortex* modifier drags the particles into a vortex. Each particle's speed and direction is altered by the direction and magnitude of the vortex.

The particle system features more modifier types so make sure to check them out.
