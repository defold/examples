title: Hinge joint physics
brief: This example shows a simple setup with a dynamic body physics object and two dynamic wheel physics object joined together with a joint of type "hinge". The hinge joint can simulate an axle or a pin on which other object is rotating in respect to the base. The example shows how to create, destroy and change properties of the joints.

The setup consists of four game objects. The *game.project* physics *GravityY* property is set to -500 to match the scale of the setup.

body
: The square stone block. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with the stone block image.
  - A *Collision object* component. The *Type* is set to `DYNAMIC`. A box *Shape* matching the sprite image is added to the components.
  - A script that joines the wheel game objects to to the body and reacts to user input by changing the direction of the rotation of the hinge joints.
  - A label with an instruction to the user.

frontwheel
: The cirular metal wheel. Contains:
  - A *Sprite* component with the metal circle image.
  - A *Collision object* component. Also has *Type* set to `DYNAMIC`, *Friction* set to 0.9 and *Restitution* to 0.1. A box *Shape* matching the sprite image is added to the components.

backwheel
: The same as above.

walls
: The outer walls. Contains:
  - A *Collision object* component. The *Type* is set to `STATIC`. 4 box *Shapes* are added to the component. These are placed just outside of the game view.
